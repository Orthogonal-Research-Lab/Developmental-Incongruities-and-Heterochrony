## Brains under Metamorphosis

In the abdominal ganglia, larval neurones are retained to assume a new adult role. 

* involves not only the acquisition of a new target muscle, but also the reorganization of dendritic morphology, and alterations in the inter-connections between neurons.

* motor neurons grow new dendritic processes and changes the synaptic relationship with an abdominal stretch receptor

* interaction that was inhibitory during larval life becomes excitatory in the adult. 

* sensory neurons that evoke a larval flexion behaviour, later participate in the defensive gin trap reflex that is characteristic of the pupa. 

* formation of new pathways is a two-step process in that the new circuits do not become behaviourally relevant as they are formed, but instead are activated abruptly at the appropriate time.

Almost all adult motor neurons derive from larval motor neurons that are respecified for adult functions. 

* a subset of larval motor neurons, those which mediate larval- or ecdysis-specific behaviours, die before and immediately after
eclosion, respectively. 

* many adult interneurons develop from larval interneurons, whereas those related to complex adult sense organs originate during larval life from persisting embryonic neuroblasts.
