Working directory for the paper "[Explaining Developmental Incongruity Through Dynamical Heterochrony](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Proposals/blob/master/ALife%2019/Developmental-Incongruity-Heterochrony.md)"

This repository consists of the following:  

1) Jupyter notebook with notes on the mathematics and theory behind heterochrony. 

* topics include growth model >> sequence model >> compound model >> critical period >> dynamical systems.  

2) pdf and reveal.js version of the notebook.

* render without JupyterLab (reveal.js version: http://orthogonal-research-lab.github.io/Compound-Heterochrony.html).

* printable version (pdf file in repository).

3) a talk abstract: "Dynamical Representations of Heterochrony and the Developmental Process".  

4) a paper: "Understanding Developmental Incongruity Through Dynamical Heterochrony".
