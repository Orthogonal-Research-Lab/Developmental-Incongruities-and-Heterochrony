Working directory for compound heterochrony (heterochrony with delay differential equations).  

This repository will consist of the following:  

1) Jupyter notebook with notes on the mathematics and theory behind heterochrony. 

* topics include growth model >> sequence model >> compound model >> critical period >> dynamical systems.  

2) reveal.js version of the notebook.

* render without JupyterLab.  

3) an talk abstract submitted to Dynamics Days 2019.
