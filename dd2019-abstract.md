# Dynamical Representations of Heterochrony and the Developmental Process
### Bradly Alicea

The original theory of heterochrony [1,2] provides us with a generalized quantitative perspective on the dynamics of developmental trajectories. While useful, these developmental trajectories merely characterize changes in the speed and extent of growth in developmental time.  More recent work on sequence heterochrony [3] reconsiders heterochrony as a series of developmental events such as tissue development or morphogenetic transformations positioned according to their relative occurrence. One open problem in the literature involves how to characterize developmental trajectories, particularly for rare modes of development. By applying better representations of development along with the appropriate mathematical constructs, we hope to reveal interesting features of changes in growth given the plasticity and complexity of developmental timing.  

This talk will present a range of potential dynamical approaches to characterizing heterochrony [4] in a way that goes beyond existing models. Our approach is unique in that we reconsider the developmental trajectory as a series of autonomous developmental programs that contribute to changes in growth and form. With a focus on developmental timing, we will use formal techniques to characterize delays and bifurcations in the developmental trajectory. We also consider the role of multiple developmental programs operating either in parallel or serially that are able to characterize some of the immense diversity observed in animal development. Along the way, we will employ concepts such as delay dynamical equations and bifurcation theory that can enrich our understanding of heterochrony and complex developmental processes more generally.
